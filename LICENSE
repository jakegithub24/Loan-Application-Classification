                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  A summary of your rights under this license:

  - Commercial use: You can use this software for commercial purposes
  - Modification: You can modify the software
  - Distribution: You can distribute the software
  - Patent use: This license provides an express grant of patent rights
  - Private use: You can use this software privately
  - Liability: The license provides a limit on product liability
  - Warranty: The license explicitly states that the software is provided "as-is"

  Conditions:
  - License and copyright notice: Include a copy of the license and copyright notice
  - State changes: State significant changes made to the software
  - Disclose source: Provide source code of the software when distributing
  - Network use: If you run a modified program on a server and let users use it over a network, you must provide the source code to the users
  - Same license: All modifications must use the same license
  - Library usage: If you link to this library, your work must use this license

  Limitations:
  - Liability: The software is provided without warranty
  - Trademark use: This license does not grant you permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names

  This license is compatible with the GNU GPLv3, but extended with
  network use copyleft requirements.
